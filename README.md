# Abstract
Driven by the need for cost-effective surveillance solutions in high-risk
environments, this project aims to develop an AI-powered rover equipped with 
machine learning algorithms for object recognition. By analyzing data from its 
camera and potential sensors, the rover will be trained to identify and classify 
objects within its surroundings. This cost-effective approach surpasses traditional 
systems' practicality in risky scenarios, enabling faster and more accurate object 
detection through advanced algorithms. Ultimately, the project contributes to the 
development of affordable intelligent surveillance solutions, promoting improved 
monitoring and faster response times even in situations where deploying 
expensive equipment is impractical.
